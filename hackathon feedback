Alias game.
Once again a fantastic hackathon project that shows how far you've gotten with your studies!
I love games and this one in paticular.
The code is orginised very well with routes, serving from static public folder, your use of SQL & a DOTENV file.
Excellent progress and fun game! Good job.
